## Runtime proof

- FastAPI health endpoint: `GET /api/v1/health`
- Unconfigured durable-worker idle verification: `cmp-worker --once --json`
- Generated client calls a live Uvicorn process in integration tests
- Worker starts in a separate subprocess and exits successfully in one-cycle mode
- OIDC validation uses exact issuer/audience, explicit asymmetric algorithms, configured JWKS,
  access-token type checking, required organization/project context, and sanitized failures
- PostgreSQL principal persistence keeps `(issuer, subject)` immutable, produces opaque UUIDv4 IDs,
  and serializes concurrent JIT provisioning without duplicate actors
- PostgreSQL authorization runs under a non-owner `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` role with
  transaction-local principal/tenant/permission/clearance context
- Classification-aware RLS filters list/count/facet operations and rejects cross-project or
  above-clearance writes; tenant composite FKs normalize hidden/unknown target failures
- Revision writes use concrete UUID bases, canonical SHA-256, transaction-local fail-closed hooks,
  and PostgreSQL compare-and-swap head advancement
- PostgreSQL integration uses a migration-managed explicit typed fixture; no generic EAV/content
  table exists
- Job submission is tenant-idempotent; every retry appends a distinct immutable Attempt/Job Spec
- PostgreSQL claim uses runner serialization and `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; fencing tokens reject
  stale heartbeat/finalize calls after lease recovery
- Failure/cancel/timeout attempts remain queryable, terminal attempts and Job results are immutable,
  and identical finalize calls replay without a second commit
- Job/Attempt/Runner RLS uses the same request/service principal, tenant, permission, and
  classification context as API resources
- Plugin Maintainers can register but cannot self-verify or activate; Org Admin verification and
  activation commands use a separate permission and append actor/request/trace facts
- PostgreSQL rejects plugin ID/version digest substitution, package/history mutation, activation
  before eligibility, incomplete schema/capability bundles, revoked packages, and cross-project
  access even when opaque UUIDs are known
- Active package lookup is pinned to project, plugin ID, exact version, and package digest; revoked
  or cross-project packages are hidden before runner materialization
- The local T-18 runner rehashes package/input/output bytes, safely extracts bounded ZIP entries,
  rejects links and traversal, supplies only scoped SDK I/O, and enforces parent timeout/cancel
- Network, child-process, ambient-path, symlink, oversized-output, corrupt-package, and corrupt
  Result Manifest fixtures fail closed with sanitized diagnostics
- An OCI runtime must attest every production isolation control before receiving an execution plan;
  core contains no Docker, Kubernetes, vendor runtime, or plugin implementation dependency
- Identical seeds produce byte-identical synthetic RNG output, and all seven extension types pass
  the same domain-neutral contract-echo compatibility matrix
- Upload parts stream incrementally to a fresh server-generated staging key; exact per-part and
  complete-object size/SHA-256 are checked before a Raw Asset can be committed
- Upload capabilities are deterministically signed but not persisted as plaintext, and are bound
  to session, organization, project, actor, and expiry in addition to bearer authorization
- PostgreSQL blocks part replacement, Raw Asset/Ingestion Event mutation, incomplete completion,
  invalid state transitions, cross-project reads/writes, and storage-key exposure in API contracts
- Same-classification duplicate bytes reuse one Raw Asset while appending a distinct immutable
  ingestion event; mismatch and cancellation leave no successful Raw Asset fact
- Raw Asset promotion never updates its staging fact; one separate immutable Artifact references
  it, and cross-actor duplicate ingestion reuses the same available Artifact
- PostgreSQL requires an exact promoting pending manifest before Artifact insertion and an exact
  immutable observation before integrity projection change; terminal pending/Artifact rows reject
  every mutation or deletion
- Content keys include organization, project, classification, and SHA-256; filesystem promotion
  rehashes source/final bytes and uses no-overwrite commit with idempotent identical replay
- Reconciliation recovers object-success/DB-gap, records missing/corrupt observations and
  orphan/missing-staging issues, and never rewrites an Artifact manifest
- Download grants are canonical HMAC capabilities bound to actor, tenant, Artifact, digest, and
  expiry; bearer authorization remains required and public contracts contain no object keys
- Raw Asset→synthetic revision commit records typed usage, generation, derivation, and association
  atomically; the same domain-run graph replays while digest substitution is rejected
- PostgreSQL rejects generated orphan Entity records, incomplete Activities, duplicate primary
  generation, reverse dependency cycles, cross-project reads, and every provenance mutation/delete
- T-06 typed revision transactions can install a fail-closed hook that records revision generation,
  author association/attribution, and `wasRevisionOf` in the caller's transaction
- Public provenance access is read-only Entity lookup, bounded lineage/impact, and completeness;
  moving heads, DB table details, raw payloads, and object keys are absent from the contract
- Recursive discovery and RLS-protected Entity materialization use separate bounded SQL phases so
  PostgreSQL avoids a pathological security-view join plan; known DAG paths remain deterministic
- A 10-hop chain and 10,000-edge fan-out run under the two-second query assertion, while depth 20,
  10,000 nodes, page size 1,000, cycles, duplicate paths, cursor rebinding, and graph truncation
  fail closed
- Artifact finalization and ArtifactAvailable outbox append commit or roll back together; exact
  replay emits one event, schema validation fails the transaction, and event data contains no
  object-store key
- Outbox aggregate sequence blocks out-of-order claims; publisher crash recovery replaces the
  lease token, stale fencing is rejected, poison blocks later aggregate events, and duplicate
  consumer delivery creates one inbox receipt
- Reconciliation schedules reclaim expired runs as timed out, append a fresh fenced run, execute
  the existing T-10 reconciler, and record idempotent cleanup only after discarding an eligible
  terminal pending staging object; the content-addressed final object remains intact
- Audit append derives only from an authorized modifying command; PostgreSQL serializes each
  project chain and computes sequence, previous hash, recorded time, and event hash itself
- Periodic roots cover only the next contiguous unsealed range and form their own root chain;
  application recomputation matches PostgreSQL and reports unsealed tail events separately
- Audit rows and roots reject update/delete, cross-project readers see no rows, and mutation,
  reorder, or deletion performed through a privileged tamper fixture makes integrity invalid
- Public audit access is read-only event query, bounded export, and integrity reporting; raw
  payloads, secrets, IP addresses, object keys, and generic JSON/EAV are absent from DB/contracts

## Validation result

OpenAPI compatibility: passed
make ci: 223 passed, 58 PostgreSQL-gated tests skipped without CMP_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN
Full suite with PostgreSQL 16.14: 281 passed
```

## Intentionally absent

- Public role-management API/UI and deployment-specific DB role/secret provisioning
- Export-control nationality/compartment policy (`OQ-SEC-002`)
- Material, test, or dataset catalog implementations
- Release resources and release-specific evidence/review/mapping gates (`T-30`); T-14 exposes only
  the reusable provenance-completeness report
- Production S3 adapter, KMS/object-lock/versioning/replication provisioning, external event
  transport credentials, and deployment runner credentials
- T-17 authoritative package-Artifact admission, T-18 materializer/committer deployment wiring,
  and signature/SBOM/malware/vulnerability verification automation
- A selected production OCI runtime implementation and production package/image admission policy
- Production plugins
- External audit root signer, SIEM/WORM connector, retention/legal-hold policy, and deployment
  service-principal scheduling for periodic sealing
- Constitutive equations, fitting algorithms, solver cards, or validation thresholds
- Frontend application

## Next gate

`T-05` is complete. Catalog task `T-07` is the next numbered backlog item but remains outside the
approved scope because it introduces Material/process catalog behavior. T-30 still owns Release
creation and evidence policy; T-17/T-18 production Artifact composition and release-specific
retention/backup policy are not implied complete.
